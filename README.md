# DbTwig - An Ultra-Thin Middle-Tier Framework

AsterionDB allows the Oracle database to seamlessly manage unstructured (e.g. file based) data. We migrate all of your digital assets out of the legacy file system and into the database. *(For those of you that think it's scary to store files in a database, remember, the legacy file system is a database too.)* Given that they're now in the database, we don't need to keep a static filename anymore.

Think about it, if all of your files are now stored in the database and there are no more PDFs in your directories, how does ransomware infect your files?  They're not there anymore!

**With DbTwig, everyone can build applications that are inherently secure and resistant to cybersecurity attack. If this is intriguing to you, please continue reading!**
